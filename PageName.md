"Details below"
Select a DVD shop: (drop down list that adapts to options, based on choice. First option province, then town, then specific shops. Only show online shops) - Search for a movie: (searchbar where users can type the name of a specific movie. Google instant type feedback would be great, if bandwidth allows it) - Select a movie category: (iterate through different options so people can search for particular movies. When a particular movie has been selected, use should be able to click a "book at my DVD store" button, which then goes through the same process as "Select a DVD shop", but only showing shops which have this DVD (with shops not having it available for today a lighter shade or something) - register a new DVD shop: DVD shop owners can click here to (a) download or free software and (b) register their business. For now, I think we should verify each business ourselves (or appoint someone to do it). So they download and install the software and get a code to link their shop to our database as soon as they've been verified)
